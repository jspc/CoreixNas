This directory will store our prototypes for FS specific tasks.
This will promote standardisation and ensure features work identically across the board.

There are a couple of important methods to take into account here:

grow_fs( image_file, device, new_size, mountpoint )
shrink_fs( image_file, device, new_size, mountpoint )

We put the mountpoint last because for some filesystems it is worthless (ext3 testing uses this) and so
a module may safely discard it.

Others methods may be created as internals, but will never be called anywhere else
